## Project Aim ##
According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US.
About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.
Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare and that is why I thought of using machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.
